# Lung Cancer Diagnosis Using CNNs and Dynamic Weighted Hypergraphs  

This project introduces a novel approach for the precise and timely diagnosis of lung cancer through the integration of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Dynamic Weighted Hypergraphs**. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system enhances diagnostic accuracy and supports early detection.

## Features  
- **Histopathological Image Analysis**: Analyzes cellular distortions in lung tissues to identify cancerous patterns.  
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Employs CNNs to extract complex features such as textural patterns and shapes from images.  
- **Hypergraph-Based Analysis**: Models high-dimensional feature relationships for richer data interpretation.  
- **Enhanced Classification Accuracy**: Combines CNNs and hypergraphs to improve early lung cancer diagnosis.  
- **Potential Clinical Impact**: Saves lives by enabling early detection and reducing healthcare costs.
